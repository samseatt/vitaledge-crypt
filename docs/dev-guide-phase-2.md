## **2. Remaining Development Tasks**

### **2.1. Shared Libraries for External Systems**

#### **A. VitalEdge Kit-iOS**
- **Objective**:
  - Generate a shared library in C++ that can be consumed by a Swift iOS application using Xcode.
  - Provide APIs for encryption, decryption, and obfuscation.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Create a Platform-Specific Build**:
     - Use `CMake` to generate an iOS-compatible shared library.
     - Add a `CMakeLists.txt` file with settings for Apple platforms:
       ```cmake
       set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME iOS)
       set(CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 13.0)
       set(CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES "arm64;x86_64")
       ```

  2. **Export C++ Functions to Swift**:
     - Use Objective-C++ (`.mm` files) as a bridge between Swift and C++.
     - Wrap core cryptographic functions in Objective-C++ classes.

  3. **Distribute the Library**:
     - Package the shared library for easy inclusion in Xcode projects.
     - Create a Swift interface (`.swift` file) to expose cryptographic APIs.

- **Example Task**:
  - Encrypt data using the shared library:
    ```swift
    let encrypted = CryptoLibrary.encrypt(data: "Hello, VitalEdge!", key: "0123456789abcdef", iv: "abcdef0123456789")
    ```

---

#### **B. VitalEdge Kit-watchOS**
- **Objective**:
  - Implement obfuscation functionality only, optimized for watchOS constraints.
  - Generate a lightweight shared library for obfuscation tasks.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Optimize for Limited Resources**:
     - Ensure the obfuscation logic is lightweight and efficient.
     - Minimize memory usage and avoid complex algorithms.

  2. **Build watchOS-Compatible Library**:
     - Follow the same steps as iOS, ensuring compatibility with watchOS deployment targets.

  3. **Expose APIs in Swift**:
     - Similar to iOS, use Objective-C++ and Swift interfaces for the obfuscation API.

---

#### **C. VitalEdge Pi IoT**
- **Objective**:
  - Generate a Python-compatible shared library for encryption and decryption.
  - Use `pybind11` to expose C++ functions to Python.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Install `pybind11`**:
     - Add `pybind11` as a submodule or install it via package manager:
       ```bash
       brew install pybind11
       ```

  2. **Expose C++ Functions**:
     - Create a Python binding file (e.g., `bindings.cpp`):
       ```cpp
       #include <pybind11/pybind11.h>
       #include "VitalEdgeCrypto.h"

       PYBIND11_MODULE(VitalEdgeCrypto, m) {
           m.def("encrypt", &VitalEdgeCrypto::encryptAES);
           m.def("decrypt", &VitalEdgeCrypto::decryptAES);
       }
       ```

  3. **Build the Python Library**:
     - Add a `CMakeLists.txt` file for the Python library:
       ```cmake
       find_package(pybind11 REQUIRED)
       pybind11_add_module(VitalEdgeCrypto bindings.cpp)
       ```

  4. **Test in Python**:
     - Import the library in Python and call the encryption functions:
       ```python
       import VitalEdgeCrypto

       encrypted = VitalEdgeCrypto.encrypt("Hello, Pi!", "key", "iv")
       decrypted = VitalEdgeCrypto.decrypt(encrypted, "key", "iv")
       ```

### **2.2. Centralized Key Management**

#### **Objective**:
Integrate with a key management service to securely manage encryption keys.

#### **Key Vault Options**:
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**:
  - Use the AWS SDK for C++ to interact with KMS for key storage and retrieval.

- **HashiCorp Vault**:
  - Use Vault's REST API to fetch and rotate keys.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Add Key Vault API Integration**:
   - Implement a `KeyManager` class that communicates with the chosen key vault.
   - Example API for key retrieval:
     ```cpp
     std::string KeyManager::fetchKey(const std::string& keyId);
     ```

2. **Secure Key Caching**:
   - Store keys securely in memory.
   - Avoid logging sensitive data.

3. **Support Key Rotation**:
   - Add API for rotating encryption keys:
     ```cpp
     void KeyManager::rotateKey(const std::string& keyId);
     ```

---

### **2.3. Optimize Performance**

#### **Objective**:
Improve the handling of large datasets and concurrent requests.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Add support for batch encryption and decryption via REST API endpoints.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "data": ["data1", "data2", "data3"],
       "key": "key",
       "iv": "iv"
     }
     ```

2. **Concurrency**:
   - Use Drogon's built-in thread pool to handle high-concurrency scenarios.
   - Test with tools like `Apache Bench` (`ab`) or `wrk`.

3. **Profiling and Optimization**:
   - Use tools like `valgrind` or `perf` to identify bottlenecks.
   - Optimize cryptographic algorithms using OpenSSL's performance tuning options.

---

### **2.4. Deployment**

#### **Objective**:
Containerize and deploy the application to a production environment.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Containerize with Docker**:
   - Refactor the Dockerfile for production (minimize image size, remove build tools).

2. **Deploy to AWS ECS**:
   - Use AWS Fargate for serverless container hosting.
   - Create an ECS task definition for the container.

3. **Orchestrate with Kubernetes**:
   - Use a `kubernetes.yaml` file to define deployments and services.

---

## **3. Next Steps**
- Focus first on completing shared library builds for iOS, watchOS, and Pi IoT.
- After library support, integrate key management.
- Finally, optimize performance and deploy the application.
